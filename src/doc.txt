    used to store information about the tree structure, the position in ST and the value itself

SCANNER:
The scanner has a few helper functions like:
 - detect : detects the type of a token given the string representation
 - genereate_pif : given a list of tokens it categorises, checks for lexical errors and constructs the PIF
 - process_program : given a file name it splits the text into tokens and generates the PIF
 - test_output_program : used for reconstructring a program from PIF - for testing purposes
 - test_program : checks if the program is valid from a lexical point of view
 - read_pif : reads a file and reconstructs the in memory structure of PIF
