Finite automata class:
 - constructor - takes a file and returns the FA
 - parse_file - reads the FA from a file
 - _check - checking logic
 - check_sequence - wrapper method used to check a sequence


FA file format:

file_content = states "\n" alphabet "\n" transitions "\n" initial_state "\n" final_states

letter = "a" | "b" | ... | "z" | "A" | "B" | ... | "Z"
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | ... | "9"

states = state ["," states]
state = letter

alphabet = symbol ["," alphabet]
symbol = letter | digit

transitions = transition [";" transitions]
transition = state "," symbol "," state

initian_state = state

final_states = states
